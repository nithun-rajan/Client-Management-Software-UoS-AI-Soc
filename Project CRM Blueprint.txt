Project CRM Blueprint -


The next several pages are dedicated to providing a holistic and comprehensive overview of everything that a new CRM build with revolutionary agentic AI at its core can and should be able to do. 


Firstly, however, it is crucial to paint the picture and divulge exactly what the issues in the industry currently are. That is to say the significant gaps in the market which are costing estate agents and the property industry as a whole which being a fragmented industry - tens of thousands of estate agents across the nation - often lacks the concentrations of power and the necessary broad overview of the industry to take action and take advantage of paradigm shifts in technology. I want to change this and firmly believe that with the help of an excellent team of AI engineers a blueprint for this mission - a living CRM - can be built. 


It is important to understand how CRM’s and estate agencies are linked. Currently most CRM’s such as Alto Software (who manage 1 in 4 UK estate agents) are legacy systems whose only purpose is storing data. You can think of Alto as an old fashioned Argos catalogue where all the information crucial to the estate agent and collected and decades of business is held. This includes all the information about the properties of their clients about their diaries and appointments. The greatest strength of these legacy CRMs is a long history where they have cultivated trust from estate agents. However, paradoxically this has led to the opportunity worth discussing in this document and worth pulling off for the hackathon. 


Legacy CRMs are unable and unwilling to reinvent a successful product using AI; this would be too costly and too risky. What's more, the knowledge and detailed understanding of LLM’s and generative AI skews to a younger demographic of coders and AI engineers, many of whom are still in university!!


Please see below the wholistic roadmap for everything a modern AI powered CRM should have based on my experience in the weeds of the industry; 


There are six key areas that an estate agents CRM should focus on at the highest level these are as follows.


* Key business KPI’s drawn through the data inputted to the CRM
* The front end of the lettings cycle 
* The back end of the lettings cycle
* Property management
* The front end of the sales cycle 
* The back end of the sales cycle








Lets first discuss the Key KPI’s (key performance indicators) for any estate agent.


The reason businesses use KPI’s is so that managers can get a clear picture of the health of their business - what's working well and what potential improvements can be worked on. Generating KPI’s can be very time consuming and is often done in the industry via manually inputting raw data into separate spreadsheets. I envisage that through an intelligent CRM key data could be picked up and automatically organised into key easy to reference data points. 


What are the Key KPI’s -


* Average Sales price per bedroom - comparing also to the asking price as in what the average sales price achieved is and what percentage of the asking price this would represent. This is a vital KPI because by understanding the average prices achieved at a high level based on bedrooms estate agents can quickly and more reliably estimate potential values of new properties. Understanding how the achieved prices compare to the asking prices is crucial as this indicates which party has the power in the market. For instance in a buyers market where buyers have more influence we would expect the asking prices to be higher than the achieved prices whereas in a sellers market we would expect that asking or near asking price achieved prices could be maintained. Gauging who has the power in a market is important information for estate agents as this allows them to more easily manage the expectations of buyers and sellers. 
* Average let agreed price - comparing also to the asking price as in what the average rent achieved is and what percentage of the asking price this would represent. This is a vital KPI because by understanding the average prices achieved at a high level based on bedrooms estate agents can quickly and more reliably estimate potential values of new properties. Understanding how the achieved prices compare to the asking prices is crucial as this indicates which party has the power in the market. For instance in a renters market where renters have more influence we would expect the asking prices to be higher than the achieved prices whereas in a landlords market we would expect that asking or near asking price achieved prices could be maintained. Gauging who has the power in a market is important information for estate agents as this allows them to more easily manage the expectations of renters and landlords. 
* Listing to sales ratio, with a detailed breakdown of why listings are lost. This is a crucial KPI because before earning any commission estate agents have to complete on properties and exchange or on the rental side have tenants move in. Quickly understanding what the conversion rate from the pipeline of available properties to sold or rented properties is important as this helps the agency understand roughly what percentage of their available stock will be turned to cash. For the sake of an example imagine an estate agent had 10 properties worth 1 million pounds each and charged a 1% fee. This would mean a pipeline worth £100,000. If it was established that that agent had a conversion rate or a listing to sales ratio of 90% the manager of the branch could forecast an income of £90,000 for the branch from the existing pipeline. 
* Days on the market, as mentioned, estate agents only get paid on successful completion of the transaction. This means that there is often a long tailwind between doing the work and getting paid; this can lead to cashflow problems. Understanding the time properties spend on the market helps directors and managers forecast and account for cashflow problems. 


* Fees generated - through commissions (selling and letting properties) aswell as miscellaneous income through things like upselling cleaners a piechart showing monthly revenue would be the best way forward here.
* Customer satisfaction - this is a KPI for the property management team. Property management is a job that estate agents do primarily to keep business (margins are low) and the main indicator of success in property management is whether tenants and landlords feel happy with that estate agent. Typically customer feedback forms are sent out periodically (quarterly would be a good length of time) to landlords and tenants to gauge how happy tenants and landlord are and subtly find out if there are any issues with the ongoing service. The AI based CRM should do this automatically, reaching out to tenants and landlords and requesting their feedback. From the data collected here a temperature gauge can be built on the KPI indicator page in the CRM indicating how happy and satisfied customers are
  



This is roughly how I envisage the KPI page looking.








The front end of the lettings cycle 


Each estate agent will organise the tasks to be completed differently, however, for the sake of our CRM and it’s UI the front end of the lettings cycle will refer to everything that is done between a landlord first deciding to instruct the estate agent to the offer from the prospective tenant being accepted. 


Lets dive into an overview of all the possible tasks that could be involved and where I trust AI can be embedded to improve the process. 


First we will go over the landlord's perspective and what the agent and subsequently the CRM needs to do here then we will go over what the tenants perspective is and what needs to be done on this side of the equation. 


The main ways a landlord reaches out to an estate agent are as follows - through calling the office - through a valuation request via email from one of the property portals or simply by walking into the office. It is my view that this stage of the process is not yet automatable through AI. This is because valuations are more tailored and situation specific than viewings. However, the CRM should be able to automatically provide the agent with a valuation pack.


Here is an example valuation pack I have made for a property in Southampton using Gemini, the CRM should be able to make valuation packs like the below for estate agents completely hands free and accurately.

	Key takeaway: The recent sale of Flat 6, Banister Court for £185,000 (April 2025) is the strongest comparable, indicating the maximum achieved price for a standard flat on Court Road itself. The subject property, with its desirable feature of a second bathroom (en-suite), should command a premium over this value.

Recommended Valuation and Price Range
Based on the market analysis, we would suggest marketing the property within the following price range:
Price Range
	£190,000 - £205,000
	Given the current Guide Price is £195,000 (and has been reduced, suggesting it was likely initially marketed higher), this range supports the existing strategy but offers a clear upper limit.

Valuation Logic and Reasoning
1. Comparable Property Analysis (Core Value)
* Baseline Value: The strongest local comparable, Flat 6, Banister Court, sold for £185,000 in April 2025. This sets a firm base for the property's value on Court Road.
* Premium for En-Suite: The subject property stands out by having two bathrooms (an en-suite plus a family bathroom), whereas many comparable flats in older blocks only have one. In the immediate area, the active comparables that also feature two bathrooms (Archers Road at £215k, Hulse Road at £210k) are asking for prices significantly higher than the Court Road baseline. This feature is highly desirable, especially for sharers or couples, and justifies a premium of £10,000 - £15,000 over the £185,000 baseline, placing the value around £195,000 - £200,000.
* Off-Road Parking: The inclusion of an allocated off-road parking space is a major benefit in this central location and further enhances value.
* "Updated Flat" Status: The listing mentions a "Spacious updated flat with new lease," indicating a good internal presentation and low maintenance for the buyer, supporting a value at the upper end of the local range.
2. Location and Infrastructure
* Train Station Proximity: The property is excellently located for commuters, being approximately:
   * 0.8 miles to Southampton Central Train Station.
   * 0.9 miles to St Denys Train Station.
   * This "walking distance" access to a major hub like Southampton Central is a key value driver in the SO15 postcode.
* Amenities and City Centre: The flat is located within a 5-minute drive of the City Centre and is advertised as being "Walking Distance to Town Centre," which appeals strongly to first-time buyers, investors, and city workers.
* Schools: The area benefits from local schools such as Banister Primary School and Shirley Junior School nearby, which maintains appeal for small families.
3. Market Conditions (UK/Southampton)
* Interest Rate Environment: The current UK property market is sensitive to high interest rates, which typically dampen buyer demand and reduce bidding wars, particularly for flats that often attract first-time buyers relying on mortgages. This factor suggests that achieving a price significantly over the Guide Price may be challenging without exceptional demand.
* Local Market Trends: While national data shows some pressure, the immediate area around Court Road has seen a steadying of prices. The properties in nearby buildings (Gwen Rhian Court) had an average value of £156,763 as of August 2025, but the recent sale of a similar flat for £185,000 (Apr 2025) demonstrates that well-presented units are still achieving strong prices, especially those with modern features like the subject property's en-suite.
* Investor Appeal: With strong rental growth predicted (average rental price in the area is around £1,032 pcm), the property has high appeal for investors, which creates a second pool of motivated buyers and helps underpin the valuation.
Conclusion
The subject property is superior to the £185,000 sold comparable due to its key advantage of having two bathrooms and good presentation. It competes directly with the asking prices of comparable 2-bedroom/2-bathroom units on Archers and Hill Lane, which are asking £215,000-£220,000 but may be in more premium apartment blocks.
The estimated market price of £195,000 is a fair and achievable target, aligning it with its original guide price and reflecting a reasonable premium for the en-suite and parking, while acknowledging the £185,000 local sale baseline and current market caution. A motivated buyer or investor could push the price towards the upper range of £205,000.


After the valuation is completed and the landlord has agreed to list the property onto the market with the estate agent the agent needs a way to record two things - all of the detail about the property under a section on the UI called properties this section will be divided up into different groups including - properties to let (still available and on the market) - properties let by (where offers have been accepted and the properties are in the progressions tab) - properties managed (where all the managed properties are).

                                    56. Audit log of changes (who changed what & when)




  
 
Taking all this in I believe that the UI for the property page should look something like this front end. Clean easy to interpret and with the key documentation easy to access/interpret and a detailed notes section where records can be kept.
Following a successful valuation the second task of the estate agent is to record and make a card for the landlord. To record all of the landlords key information, this should be as follows;


Each landlord record should be a central node linked to:
                                       * Properties owned

                                       * Tenancies (via property ownership)

                                       * Documents (KYC, ID, contracts)

                                       * Financial transactions (rents received, fees, invoices)


🧩 2. Comprehensive Field & Feature List for the Landlord Record
A. Basic Identity & Contact Information
                                          1. Full Name / Trading Name (if company landlord)

                                          7. Registered business address (for company landlords)

                                          8. Preferred contact method (call, email, SMS, post)

B. Verification & Compliance (AML / KYC)
These are crucial — UK agents have strict Money Laundering Regulations (MLR) obligations under HMRC and the Right to Rent framework.
                                             11. AML check status (Pass / Fail / Pending / Expired)

                                             16. Politically Exposed Person (PEP) flag

                                             17. Sanctions list check flag (and reference ID)

                                             18. Company verification number (Companies House)

                                             19. AML agent name (who performed check)

                                             20. AML provider used (e.g., SmartSearch, Credas, Onfido)

                                             21. Notes from AML officer

🟦 Automation tip: System auto-flags any AML doc expiring within 12 months and creates a “Reverify AML” task. - this is key I want automated reminders for as much as possible this should be the most user friendly CRM on the market.

                                                22. Bank account name

                                                23. Sort code / Account number (masked view for staff)

                                                30. It is important to note that the CRM will not be taking or making payments just recording them.

🧭 3. Suggested UI Layout (for when we move to the design stage)
Use a similar visual language to your KPI dashboard and property card:
                                                                        * Top header: Landlord name, status ribbon (Active/Under AML review), key KPIs (properties, rent roll, open issues).

                                                                        * Left column: Contact & compliance summary.

                                                                        * Right column: Bank details, AML check widget, document checklist (with expiry badges).

                                                                        * Tabs / Cards:

                                                                           * Overview (summary KPIs, relationship notes)

                                                                           * Properties (linked records table)

                                                                           * Financials (statements, balances)

                                                                           * Compliance & Docs (upload + expiry)

                                                                           * Communication (emails, calls, notes)

Color cues:
🟩 Green – up to date AML/documents
🟧 Amber – due soon
🟥 Red – expired or missing document


  



This is how I think the UI could look to cover the above points in terms of registering the landlord. 


Now we have built a way for landlords and properties to be registered and the data inputted to our CRM we need to look at the other aspect of the front end job of an estate agency. This is registering prospective tenants, commonly referred to as applicants and this will be how I refer to them in this document. 
The first stage of an applicant's life cycle is the initial conversation with the estate agent called the registration. This is where the key details are gathered so that the estate agent can best assist on the property search. The key here is to uncover as much data and information about the applicant as possible so that you can tailor your pitches (as the agent) and suggest the best possible properties for the applicant. The key here is to ask great questions, however, as almost all registration conversations are the same this presents our CRM an opportunity to step in and register applicants on the behalf of the estate agent through AI. Recording and transcribing the details of its conversations on the applicant tab saving the agents a huge amount of time and giving them a great first impression and collecting the key information to help their ongoing property search. Adding good and accurate relevant information to the CRM is key as more often than not the first property applicants enquire about does not end up being the property they move into so often estate agents have to show the same applicants multiple properties before that applicant finds the right home. 
Please see below the key applicant registration questions on the lettings side - these are the same questions I asked applicants and that helped me let 12 properties in one month. 
What is your ideal move date?, why
Who will be living with you at the property?
Do you have any pets?
What budget were you looking up to?
How will you be funding the rent?
Are there any other key criteria or must haves for you in your new home - things like a south facing garden, any schools you’d want to be near?


The automated response should cover and ask these questions automatically adding this to the CRM.


Going to the CRM applicant cards will be needed in a similar manner to the landlord and property cards we have described above. 
Please see below a comprehensive list of what needs to be on the applicants card on the CRM,
Great — here’s a detailed breakdown of how the applicants (prospective tenants) side of the lettings module should work, based on what leading UK CRMs (Alto, Reapit, Jupix) currently offer and best-practice for estate agents. This will help your developers build a robust “Applicant Record” module.

✅ What leading CRMs do for Applicant/Prospective Tenant records
Here are a few features from the market:
                                                                              * Reapit describes the “Applicant Record” as “all applicant info on single-screen … from marketing consent and key requirements to offers and applicant status. Easily match applicants with suitable properties.” reapit.com+1

                                                                              * Jupix supports “Property matching from the applicant screen … modify criteria, send matches to applicant” for both sales and lettings. support.jupix.com+1

                                                                              * Alto offers “Applicant matching” in their Lettings CRM (smart match engine, match emails, quick search) and a portal where applicants book viewings and have some self-service. Alto Software+1

                                                                              * Many systems integrate communications (email/SMS), automatic matching, property sending, viewing scheduling and applicant status management.

So the CRM should cover all these core applicant workflows.

🎯 Key differences compared to Property & Landlord modules
                                                                                                               * Applicant data is demand side (tenant) rather than supply side (property/landlord). So emphasis is on requirements, matching, status progression, offers, references — whereas properties emphasise attributes, compliance, rent, documents, landlord emphasises ownership & bank details.

                                                                                                               * The applicant workflow is shorter and more dynamic: registration → matching → viewing → offer → reference → tenancy.

                                                                                                               * Matching engine and communication workflows are more important on applicant side.

                                                                                                               * Consent/marketing and preference data are more critical for applicants (GDPR, property alerts).

                                                                                                               * Viewings scheduling and feedback loops are heavily applicant-centric.

                                                                                                               * Status tracking matters: you’ll want to easily see where in the pipeline each applicant is (e.g., “Waiting references”, “Offer accepted”, “Tenancy started”).

  

This is what we should work towards when building the UI for the applicants side.
We have now peaced together the entire process of the front end of lettings. Except for the necessity of the CRM to send out matches. As mentioned earlier good registration is key because more often than not applicants need to go to multiple viewings before deciding on a property. This creates a need for estate agents to be constantly following up on applicants. For instance as a negotiator I used to spend one day a week calling through applicants and one morning a week sending out “property match” emails to my applicants. This represents about 15-20% of my time as an estate agent and the CRM should be capable of sending matches automatically using AI. Either through phone calls emails or whatsapp. The matches should be personalised and should use the information gathered in the registration phase to hook the applicants. For instance if the applicant mentions they have a dog named fluffy the AI matching agent should automatically reach out and send a personal note inside the match saying something like I think Fluffy would love this 80 foot south facing back garden. The more personal the match the more likely the agent is to engage the applicant. This is why data on the properties and data on the applicants is SO important and we need the applicant and property cards to store a lot of key information. Matches should be sent at timed intervals. I liked to do them once a week!


The Back End of the Lettings Cycle - 
The back end of the lettings cycle refers to everything that happens once the offer is accepted. This means we go from a property to let to a property let be all the way to potentially a managed property. The applicant meanwhile transitions from a prospective tenant to a tenant.
Here is a detailed break down of the steps involved in the lettings progression stage,


1.1
	Log Offer Details to CRM
	Update Applicant Record (E) with: Property ID, Agreed Rent, Tenancy Term, Proposed Start Date, and any Special Conditions (e.g., Pet Clause).
	Records the key commercial terms.
	1.2
	Log Offer as Accepted
	Change Applicant Status (B) to "Offer Accepted." Change Property Status to "Let by"
	Triggers the start of the progression timeline.

This is what the tenancy progressor should see on their side. We need to make it easy to use and easy to understand with automated reminders and pointers. This section of the lettings process is harder to automate ideas to help automate could be through AI written emails. 








Property Management Aspect - 
Property management refers to everything that happens after the new tenant/s move in to the day that they leave. Property management is a job often insulated from technological change, however, I believe this is the aspect of estate agency that we can most heavily disrupt using AI. 
Please see below a list of all the jobs done by property managers, they are stratified into

Here is an example of how the UI should look for a property manager - effectively an automated to do list. I am keen to explore the possibility of using AI to interact with customers and serving as the middle man between tenants, landlords and contractors.
Property managers should be able to have their own separate portfolio - branches often have multiple property managers and the UI for each property manager should be specific and generated to reflect the tasks to be done for that specific property manager's portfolio. 
They should also be able to open specific property cards where key data could be stored such as the EPC documents. 
This covers the entire estate agency lettings business. From start to the finish!


Let’s look into the sales process 
Sales Front End
The process for the front end of sales is fortunately relatively similar to the front end of lettings. This is to say that in principle all of the key events map almost perfectly. Largely the only difference is in the terminologies used. For example landlords are vendors and applicants refers now to buyers not tenants. 
The front end of the sales process starts with the vendor/seller side. The first step here is that the prospective vendor will contact the estate agent to discuss a property they would like to put onto the market; this will lead to a valuation of the property. Our CRM should be able to automatically create valuation packs on the behalf of estate agents pulling together information found online and details about prices achieved for comparable properties held by the estate agent. The valuation pack should be detailed and explain briefly the current market situation based on our KPI’s and provide a range of potential prices suggesting a price at which the property should go quickly and the price which a vendor may be able to hold out for. The valuation pack should be easy to interpret and include suggestions on things the vendor could do to influence the price.
Here is how AI generated Valuation packs should look on the sales side,

Recommended Valuation and Price Range
 Based on the market analysis above, we suggest marketing the property in the following range:
Price Range
	Strategy
	£205,000 - £215,000
	Quick-sale price band — fair value to generate strong enquiry and faster exchange.
	£220,000 (Guide Price)
	Balanced pricing: aligns with active market and allows room for negotiation; realistic for the property given its features.
	£240,000 - £250,000+
	Aspirational price band — achievable only if the property is in excellent condition, larger size (above average for the block), lease length favourable, low charges and exemplary presentation.

Valuation Logic and Reasoning
                                                                                                                  1. Comparable Property Analysis (Core Value)

                                                                                                                     * The strongest recent transaction: 6 Moore Close at £210k (Jan-24). This provides a solid foundation for value.

                                                                                                                     * Units of similar size/spec in the same development achieved £247k-£260k in 2022 — indicating upside for premium units.

                                                                                                                     * Active listings at £220k-£235k signify current market appetite.

                                                                                                                        2. Premium for Two Bathrooms & Condition

                                                                                                                           * The subject property’s second bathroom/en-suite adds a premium relative to many flats in older blocks with one bath.

                                                                                                                           * Allocated parking + modern build (2017) boost appeal and value.

                                                                                                                              3. Location & Infrastructure

                                                                                                                                 * Moore Close (Banister Park) is highly accessible: walking distance to city centre, good transport, leisure amenities and Southampton Common — strong locational datapoint.

                                                                                                                                 * Newer build, low maintenance appeal vs older stock in SO15.

                                                                                                                                    4. Market Conditions

                                                                                                                                       * Flat/apartment markets are generally more sensitive to interest-rates and mortgage availability compared to houses — while demand remains, buyer caution can affect top bands.

                                                                                                                                       * Given the flat is in a strong micro-location, the recommended guide centre price (£220k) is realistic.

________________


Conclusion
 The subject property is slightly superior to the benchmark £210k sale due to its two-bathrooms, modern build and parking. A marketing strategy centred around £220,000 gives a realistic target with the potential to achieve offers in the £210k-£235k band if presentation is strong. Should the property meet all top-unit criteria (larger size, excellent condition, favourable lease & charges) then the £240k-£250k+ range becomes plausible.






Following a successful valuation the next step is to register the details of the vendor onto the CRM if this has not been done.

Here is a moc UI that explains how this could look in the end.


Much like at the front end of the lettings process. It is often the case that applicants need multiple viewings before deciding and finalising on a property. To be a successful sales agent you need to therefore understand what your buyers are looking for. This means registration is crucial and asking the right questions to understand your buyers needs is a vital job which the CRM can and should automate in a similar fashion. Here are some key buyer registration questions that can help estate agents learn about their clients and find more people the right properties faster.
Have you got an ideal timeframe for moving? 
What's prompting the move?
What price are you looking up to?
What condition are you looking for done up or are you willing to take on more of a project?
What tenure are you looking for, leaseholds or freeholds?
Have you got a property to sell before buying?
If yes then is your current property already on the market or under offer?
Are you a first time buyer?
Have you got a mortgage in principle or will this be a cash purchase?
Are there any other key criteria such as being near certain schools or parking?


Correctly implementing an automated call back agent for the sales side would be very impressive - this is often more technical than the registration of tenants because there are more technicalities like how the property will be paid for if there will be a chain etc that these questions try to get to the bottom of. 
The details of the phone call should be automatically transcribed to the CRM. And used to send automatic matches to that applicant.
Sending automatic property matches is important as this is a huge time drain on estate agents. A big part of the job is making people aware of properties coming onto the market and drumming up interest to arrange viewings and open houses which get stock sold! 
Currently much like letting agents estate agents on the sales side spend hours matching properties each week manually sending emails manually dialling potential clients. This should all be automated and clients should be reached out automatically and personally via email and text with the potential for viewings being booked in automatically based on negotiators availability. 
Automatic property matches should be personalised to the specific applicant based off of the registration questions such as if the applicant mentions on registration that they are a young family the automatic email/text should mention something like Only a 5 minute walk to X primary school!! (should this be true of course).




In terms of producing the applicant card where the data and information for the prospective buyer is stored the information that is required to be easily accessed/inputted is as follows.

                                                                                                                                                                                 * Tasks & Reminders — follow-ups, AIP expiry checks, viewing confirmations.

11) GDPR / CONSENTS / PERMISSIONS
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Marketing consents — email/sms/phone (with timestamp & method of collection).

These are the minimum required to have a functional buyer record and begin automated matching and outreach.


In the end I envision this looking something like this on the estate agents side,
  

Now we have covered the front end of sales we need to have systems in place to manage the back end of the sales process. This involves everything from the stage at which the offer is accepted to the stage at which contracts are exchanged. This is one of the most technically challenging parts of estate agency because emotions are high fall throughs are up to 20% of properties and the process is often long drawn out and complex with long chains and lots of independent parties weighing in on the deal trying to renegotiate etc. 
The job of sales progression is often managed by dedicated sales progressors and it is my view that this process is harder to automate because the number of edge cases likely exceeds any standards. 
Please see a comprehensive list of the back end sales process and what the CRM should do to track this process (at this fiddly stage of the process the CRMs main job should be as a virtual check list and reminding agent.).
